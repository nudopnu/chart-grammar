# chart-grammar ðŸ“ˆ
A custom grammar for parsing bar and line charts in a [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)-like style. 

## Setup

Run 

```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

And start a server with the `index.html` in the `example` folder.

## Why?

I was unhappy with the state of [mermaid's XY-Chart](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/xyChart.html) (currently in beta) and decided to create my own solution.
